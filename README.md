# PlacePicker

In this project, you will see a beautiful gallery of vacation destinations in which you can select the trip you wish to go to next! 

This project was to test my understanding of state management and React Hooks; useState, useEffect, useCallback and useRef.

If you'd like to try to run this program for yourself,

Simply run, 

npm install 

and 

npm run dev
